    <p>I wrote this code in 2017â€“18 while in AP Computer Science Principles, my very first introduction to programming.
        At
        my high school, AP CSP was taught in Java
        to prepare students who went on to take CSA, which is always taught in Java, even though the CSP exam includes
        only
        pseudocode. </p>

    <p>This repository contains projects I worked on in 2022 and 2023, while on a gap semester awaiting entry to UIS,
        primarily to fill knowledge gaps and get more practice finding and fixing bugs with various strategies, both
        applicable anywhere and peculiar to the IDE.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> runs every year from December 1 through and including
        Christmas Eve. You, the developer, are tasked
        with solving certain problems to gain stars that progressively ornament a Christmas tree. One problem is
        released
        every day. Your solution is verified in order to get the star(s), but the code you wrote is not. Puzzles for <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code">the contest</a> are new each year </p>
    <button id="css-with-dave-gray-button">CSS with Dave Gray</button>
    <br><br>
    <button id="html-with-dave-gray-button">HTML with Dave Gray</button>
    <br><br>
    <p>Both the HTML and CSS with Dave Gray repositories contain code I wrote following along with Dave's tutorials in
        each
        language for FreeCodeCamp on YouTube during the gap semester I took in late 2022. Enjoying these tutorials led
        me to
        want more formal instruction than just a series of YouTube tutorials summing to about 15 hours or so in web
        development, so I am now in CSC452 here at UIS. </p>
    <button id="data-structures-button">Data Structures Fall '23</button>
    <br><br>
    <p>This repository contains work done in CSC385 in the Fall of 2023. The course covered searching, sorting,
        recursion,
        stacks, queues, arrays, deques, trees, hashing, and the study of algorithmic complexity and Big-Omega,
        Big-Theta,
        and Big-O notation. </p>
    <button id="programming-languages-button">Intro to Programming Languages Spring '24</button>
    <br><br>
    <p>This course involved an overview of the major components of many programming languages, including how to write if
        and
        switch-case statements, various loops, typing and binding, and subprograms, showing how these concepts are
        implemented in C, Java, C++, Fortran, Pascal, Ada, Cobol, Scheme, Prolog, Perl, Python, Ruby, and F#. There was
        one
        assignment drawing parse trees and working with grammars, and there were two required programming assignments:
        one
        in Java and one in Scheme. A third, bonus programming assignment was the conversion of the code from Scheme to
        Prolog, given some restrictions on allowed symbols, in one line. </p>
