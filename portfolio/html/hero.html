    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>I started my formal education in software development in 2017, when, as a junior in high school, I took AP
        Computer
        Science Principles. There, I started from nothing, writing "Hello World" on my first day in class, and for a
        while, being hand-walked through each line of code we wrote: our first print statements, our first math
        problems, our first loops, and so forth.</p>
    <p>That experience showed me I really enjoyed software development, so when it came time to apply to college to
        enter as a first-year student in 2019â€“20, I did so as a computer science major.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have finished an Associate's degree-- completed my core classes-- within the Emory system. A year
        after being granted the degree, faced with the challenges of returning to in-person instruction as the pandemic
        response wound down, I left Emory, took a semester off and worked on programming concepts on my own, and entered
        the University of Illinois in Springfield as an online transfer student. I have taken several computer science
        classes since transferring, and I am now taking CSC452 as a summer course at UIS, the web design course for
        which this portfolio was built. I will be graduating from UIS, as things stand, in about a year, summa cum
        laude.</p>
    <p>Outside my studies at UIS online, I am an active member of my Catholic parish in Marietta in the Archdiocese of
        Atlanta. I have been involved with music for most of my life, playing the violin since 2007 and writing my own
        music since 2020.</p>
