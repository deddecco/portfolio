<h1>About Andre</h1>
<div class="container main">
    <!--    all these paragraphs get styling from the same rules as the mini-bio from the hero page-->
    <p class="bio">Like many people my age, my first exposure to programming was with Scratch, closely followed by
        Logo, when I was about 9 or 10. Encouraged by my parents, as a junior in high school in 2017â€“18, I took AP
        Computer Science Principles. CSP can be taught in any language. The exam only works in pseudocode, but
        our teacher, in case any of us were going to take the next course in the series which is AP Computer Science A,
        the next
        year, taught even CSP in Java. (CSA, in contrast to CSP, is actually universally taught in Java.)</p>
    <p class="bio">Having so thoroughly enjoyed CSP-- and having done very well in the class and the exam-- was a
        key reason that motivated me to pick majoring in Computer Science. UIS is the second school I've attended as I
        have been working toward my bachelor's degree in computer science since the fall of 2019. Both UIS and my
        previous school have taught their Intro to Programming and Data Structures courses in Java, so from high school
        until now, I've become very familiar with Java.</p>
    <p class="bio">Java is by far the language I have written the most code in, and which I am most comfortable
        in. But particularly since the beginning of 2024, when I took UIS's CSC388, my horizons have broadened
        significantly. I have gained exposure to many more languages, having completed projects in 388 in Java, Scheme,
        and
        Prolog, and having had elementary exposure to the syntax of many others.</p>
    <p class="bio">In between leaving my previous institution in August 2022 and entering UIS in January 2023, I
        shored up many programming and debugging fundamentals I had clearly found a deficit in. At the same time, I took
        tutorial courses on YouTube hosted by Dave Grey and FreeCodeCamp covering both the fundamentals of HTML5 and the
        fundamentals of CSS. Almost 2 years later, now in the summer of 2024, I am finally taking a formal class in web
        design to fulfill an elective credit. I chose this class in particular because I enjoyed those tutorials and
        wanted to learn more about web design, especially to gain exposure to and practice with JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="bio">Going about as far back as my time in CSP in high school, I have had an interest in cryptography
        and cybersecurity. One of the first classes I wanted to take when I started college in 2019-- that I could not
        take my first semester because it was full, but which I did take my second semester (the one most heavily
        disrupted by the COVID pandemic right as we were on spring break, since that break was extended by a week, and we
        were all sent home to begin online instruction) was about number theory and elementary
        cryptography.</p>
    <p class="bio">Since starting college in 2019, throughout all the challenges and changes that I've faced along
        the way, I am happy to say I feel like a much better, confident, well-rounded developer surrounded by
        a support system of mentors and instructors. I look forward to graduating from UIS in about a year-- at this
        point, with highest honors-- and entering the job market. I have a particular interest in cybersecurity, so if
        the opportunity presents itself, after gaining some experience in the industry ideally working mostly in Java, I
        may decide to return to school for graduate work to specialize in security. </p>
